# simple-crud-php
The simplest PHP CRUD, this is a homework sent by my professor of "Programaci√≥n de aplicaciones web", time given by him: 48 hours.

# PD
This can be improved a lot, due to my time and my other homeworks I cannot devote the necessary time to structure this code better, follow some best practices, etc.

# How to run
1. Import the [crud_cristian_herrera.sql](OthersFiles/crud_cristian_herrera.sql) file to your database
2. Change the connection data in [guardar.php](guardar.php), [eliminar.php](eliminar.php), and [actualizar.php](actualizar.php).
3. Open the `index.php` from your server.
